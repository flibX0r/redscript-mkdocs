# Redscript MkDocs Generator

Creates [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation from decompiled Cyberpunk 2077 scripts using jekky's [redscript decompiler](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript).

Because I'm sick of going through 17 search steps to find anything, and it's easier than writing a LSP for redscript or trying to mangle one of the existing code documentation generators to work with this uncommented language. It's also a good excuse to learn more Rust.

Uses the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme

Very much a **WORK IN PROGRESS**. Why are you even here?
